# #hack4bestcx
This is the repository I have worked with during the hackathon #hack4bestcx
at the Deutsche Telekom. The task was to predict customer satisfaction from 
a dataset including both technical telecommunication data and the contract types
of the customers. Given the high dimensionality of the data, I have focused
mainly on feature engineering and implemented two different algortihms to find the 
most helpful features for a prediction: simulated annealing and relief. The data and 
the results are censored due to the non-disclosure agreement.
